# Employee Management API with Quarkus and MySQL

## 📘 About Quarkus

Quarkus is a modern, Kubernetes-native Java framework designed for building high-performance, lightweight microservices and serverless applications. It optimizes Java for container environments, offering fast startup times, low memory usage, and developer-friendly features.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Fast boot time and low memory footprint
- Live reload during development (`quarkus:dev`)
- Native compilation support via GraalVM
- Rich extension ecosystem (REST, JPA, JDBC, Kafka, etc.)
- Unified configuration via `application.properties`

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Employee.java`: Entity class for employee data
- `EmployeeResource.java`: REST API for employee operations
- `application.properties`: Configuration for MySQL and Hibernate
- `pom.xml`: Maven build file with Quarkus dependencies

---

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. Ensure MySQL is running and the database is created.
2. Update `application.properties` with your MySQL credentials.
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn quarkus:dev
